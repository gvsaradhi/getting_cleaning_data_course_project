Creating a Tidy Data set from HAR Data-Set
========================================================

- In order to run the script to generate the expected output, run the run_analysis.R
- The script automatically creates a data directory, downloads the zip file from the url, unzips it.
- Data for the project is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
- It then performs the steps described in code-book to generate the tidy dataset by name *tidy_activity_data.txt*
